            <p>
              Hello, I'm Vivekananda Asireddy, and I'm currently looking for full time positions in 
                <a class="about-p-highlight">Java Developer</a> 
              or 
              <a class="about-p-highlight">Salesforce Developer</a>. 
              I am pursuing Masters in Business Analytics and Information Systems 
<!---<a class="about-p-highlight" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19qqbzbtdmvWYMKnpVrF98UiuJxjlWtmL/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">[degree]</a>-->
              at 
              <a class="about-p-highlight" href="https://www.asu.edu/" target="_blank">University of South Florida</a>. 
              I'm extremely passionate about leveraging cutting-edge technologies to solve complex problems through software development.
            </p>
            <p>
              My journey in the world of technology has been truly exhilarating. I had the privilege of completing a summer 
              internship at 
              <a class="about-p-highlight">mroads</a>, where I proposed novel design, and implemented systems using AWS services and CDK 
              (Cloud Development Kit). This experience allowed me to dive deep into cloud computing and build scalable solutions
              that can handle real-world challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
              My fascination with technology doesn't end with software development;
            </p>
            <p>
              Before USF, I embarked on my professional journey at Aethereus Pvt Ltd in India, where I served as a software engineer specializing 
              in Salesforce. During my time at Aethereus, I was involved in diverse projects related to application development and 
              analytics consulting for clients building end-to-end ML pipelines and leveraging data-driven insights to drive business 
              decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
              My academic journey started at Lovely Professional University, where I earned a B.Tech in Computer Science. Where I developed 
              a strong foundation in computer science, coded projects and applications. Also won first place in a gaming competition, 
              where I built a 3D endless runner game in just 24 hours.

              Beyond my technical prowess, I have a wide range of interests. I'm an avid sketch artist, and I love to work out to 
              stay physically active. My creative side extends to photography, art illustrations, and even a bit of film editing.

                      Introduced and programmed a NER (Named Entity Recognition) model (Bi-LSTM) to

                    HOW TO CULTIVATE HAPPINESS IN COMPANIES:
                    FIVE CASELETS
                </h3>
            </header>
            <br/>
            <p style="color:ghostwhite">
                <p style="color:ghostwhite">
                As a business student delving into the nuanced relationship between employee happiness and organizational success, the case studies of Thumbtack, Indiegogo, Salesforce.com, and Ferrari offer a rich tapestry of insights. These companies provide a diverse array of strategies to foster employee happiness, revealing both the benefits and potential pitfalls of such initiatives.
                </p><br/>
            <b style="color:ghostwhite; font-size:22px">Thumbtack: Balancing Flexibility with Customer Satisfaction</b>
<p style="color:ghostwhite; font-size: 16px;">                Thumbtack, a company known for its flexible work environment, highlights a critical tension between employee happiness and operational efficiency. While allowing employees to work from home with flexible hours promotes work-life balance and personal satisfaction, it can lead to inconsistent customer service. The issue of internet outages further complicates this balance, risking significant disruptions. This case underscores the importance of finding a middle ground where employee flexibility does not compromise customer experience. Companies must therefore develop robust contingency plans to mitigate such risks, ensuring that customer satisfaction remains high even as they prioritize employee well-being.</p>

<br/><b style="color:ghostwhite; font-size:22px">Indiegogo: Mission-Driven Motivation and Structured Autonomy</b><br/>
              <p style="font-size:16px; color: ghostwhite">  Indiegogo’s approach centers on its compelling mission to democratize fundraising, which naturally attracts individuals passionate about making a difference. This mission-driven culture is reinforced through hiring practices that screen for alignment with the company’s core values of collaboration, authenticity, empowerment, and fearlessness. The emphasis on autonomy is particularly noteworthy. By allowing employees to choose projects that excite them and align with their skills, Indiegogo fosters a highly motivated and engaged workforce. Regular performance reviews that include personal goal-setting further enhance this sense of autonomy. However, the downside of this approach lies in the potential for disappointment if individual happiness goals are not met, revealing the challenge of managing personal expectations within a structured organizational framework.

                <b style="color:ghostwhite; font-size: 22px">
                    Salesforce.com: Cultivating Independence and Transparent Collaboration
                </b>
                <p style="color:ghostwhite; font-size: 16px">
                    Salesforce.com demonstrates how a culture of autonomy and internal mobility can drive employee engagement. The company’s open market policy, where employees can transfer between roles freely, supports a dynamic and flexible work environment. This not only boosts employee satisfaction but also ensures that people are working on projects they are passionate about. Salesforce’s use of an internal social network, Chatter, enhances virtual collaboration, ensuring that employees remain connected and engaged even in a large organization.

                    <br/><br/>I want to give some insight into the growth strategies of salesforce. I have previously worked in a project to develop a CRM for one of edu-tech clients using Salesforce. Their strategies feel resonated in their products as well. They keep things simple and scalable at the same time. If we needed some extensions or some additional features, we would raise a ticket to the salesforce team. I was astonished at the first time when our service ticket was solved within 24 hourse of ticket raised time. Later, we had some calls with them to get a walkthrough of few things. The employees of salesforce were not confined to a particular specification of development ot UI design. They had hands-on experience with everything like reports, analysis, AI-chat bots. It was as extendable as the AWS services .
                    <br/><br/>However, the independence granted to employees can be daunting for those used to more structured environments. Additionally, the do-it-yourself model, where employees manage their own IT and administrative needs, might lead to inefficiencies and frustration, especially for those already stretched thin.

            <b style="color:ghostwhite; font-size: 22px">    Ferrari: The Elite Experience and Its Emotional Toll</b>
<p style="color:ghostwhite; font-size:16px">               Ferrari is a singular example of a person who has developed happiness by careful career preparation and a sense of superior purpose. Being a member of a well-known and prosperous brand inspires employees and encourages a strong sense of devotion and loyalty. This loyalty is increased by the company's dedication to employee welfare, which includes free medical care and mortgage assistance. Employees are instilled with a sense of ownership and pride by Ferrari through its annual competition for process improvements and internal presentations of new models. But if professional goals are not realized, this deep emotional commitment can cause unhappiness, especially for individuals who don't advance to senior management roles. Particularly younger workers could not fully understand the extraordinary privileges offered, which could foster an attitude of entitlement.

            <b style="font-size: 22px; color: ghostwhite">Applications of PACE Technique:</b>
            <p style="color: ghostwhite; font-size:16px">
                Salesforce.com’s PACE approach was evident in its efforts to align individual goals with the company’s mission (Purpose) through the V2MOM document. The company’s open market policy for internal job transfers promoted Autonomy, allowing employees to find roles they were passionate about and preventing stagnation.
                Similiarly, Ferrari’s strong sense of Purpose was ingrained in its employees, who felt part of an elite team producing world-class sports cars. The company’s career planning initiatives provided employees with a clear path for growth (Autonomy), while the emphasis on team-driven processes and benefits like housing support and medical facilities fostered a collaborative and supportive work environment
            </p>
              <br />  <b style="color:ghostwhite; font-size:20px">Conclusion</b>
                      <p style="color:ghostwhite; font-size: 16px">                The case studies of Ferrari, Salesforce.com, Thumbtack, and Indiegogo show that,  by focusing on Purpose, Autonomy, Collaboration, and Excellence, these companies have demonstrated that a happy workforce is not just a byproduct but a crucial component of achieving long-term goals. Although promoting employee happiness can boost motivation, engagement, and loyalty, there are also a number of obstacles involved. Critical skills include managing individual expectations within formal frameworks, striking a balance between flexibility and operational efficiency, and preserving autonomy without creating inefficiencies. These businesses show that fostering pleasure at work requires a complex strategy that is adapted to the unique requirements and organizational cultures. These observations offer insightful teachings on the challenges of incorporating employee well-being into organizational strategy for both executives and business students.</p>
